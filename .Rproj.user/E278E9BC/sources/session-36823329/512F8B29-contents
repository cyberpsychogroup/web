# About us

The cyberpsychology and online behaviour research group was introduced to address the rapidly developing interest in the behavioural effects of the use of digital/online technologies.

We are a diverse team of researchers with interests in the effects of telehealth applications, excessive internet use and virtual reality on human behaviour.

Our common aim is to provide evidence and guided directions on the potentially debilitating effects interwoven with the use of digital and online applications. These effects tend to be massively accessible via a range of popular devices such as personal computers and smartphones. We combine collaboration with the digital production industry and the mental health field to transcribe empirical evidence into practice. Our vision involves fostering positive public health outcomes, while accommodating industry growth.
